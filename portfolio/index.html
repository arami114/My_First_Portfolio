    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <P>Hi, I’m Oyinlade Aramide — a front-end developer with a passion for building user-friendly web applications that create real impact. I’m driven by a love for tech, creativity, and purpose, with a goal to help solve real-world challenges like job creation and limited access to technology in Nigeria. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me reading, watching anime, or exploring the exciting world of Web3. My faith keeps me grounded, and I live by Philippians 4:13 — “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”</P>

<section id="About">
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Oyinlade Aramide  a front-end developer passionate about building user-friendly web applications that solve real problems and create meaningful experiences. I enjoy turning ideas into beautiful, functional websites, and I love starting projects from scratch and watching them come to life.
My journey into tech began with a desire to make a difference, especially in areas like job creation and access to technology in Nigeria. One of my most impactful projects was working with a team to build a telemedicine app, designed to connect people in rural communities with healthcare professionals and bridge the digital divide.

Outside of tech, I’m a big fan of anime, a lover of books, and someone who finds joy in creativity and exploration—whether it’s online or in everyday life. I’m also exploring Web3 and how decentralized tech can empower communities. Guided by my faith, I live by Philippians 4:13: *“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”</p>
<p>skills: html, css, javascript, nodes.js, git and github</p>
<p>hobbies: reading, watchibg movies, coding.</p>
